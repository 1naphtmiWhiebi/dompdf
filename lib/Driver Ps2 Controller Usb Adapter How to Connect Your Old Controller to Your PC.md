- A PS2 controller. Any model of the DualShock 2 should work fine.
- A PS2 controller USB adapter. This is a small device that plugs into your PS2 controller port and converts it to a USB port. You can find these adapters online or in some electronics stores. Make sure the adapter has a hardware identifier of "VID\_0810&PID\_0001" in Windows device manager, as this is the most common and compatible type.
- A Windows 10 PC with a USB port. You can also use an older version of Windows, but you might need a different driver.

## How to Install the Driver
 
Once you have your PS2 controller and USB adapter ready, follow these steps to install the driver:

1. Plug the USB adapter into your PC's USB port.
2. Plug your PS2 controller into the USB adapter.
3. Windows 10 should automatically detect and install the driver for your USB adapter. You can check if the driver is installed by going to Device Manager and looking for "Twin USB Gamepad" under Human Interface Devices.
4. If Windows 10 does not install the driver automatically, or if you have an older version of Windows, you can download and install the driver manually from this GitHub page: https://github.com/aitte2/dualshock\_driver. This is a generic driver that adds rumble support to the USB adapter on Windows 10 and earlier. It is for 64-bit systems only!
5. To install the driver manually, download the file "VID\_0810&PID\_0001 Twin USB Gamepad 64Bit Setup.rar" from the GitHub page and extract it to a folder on your PC.
6. Run the file "InstallDriver.exe" as administrator and follow the instructions on the screen.
7. Restart your PC after installing the driver.

## How to Configure the Controller
 
After installing the driver, you can configure your PS2 controller for better performance and compatibility. Here are some steps you can take:

- To calibrate your PS2 controller, go to Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Devices and Printers. Right-click on "Twin USB Gamepad" and select "Game controller settings". Click on "Properties" and then on "Settings". Click on "Calibrate" and follow the instructions on the screen.
- To adjust the sensitivity and dead zone of your analog sticks, go to Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Devices and Printers. Right-click on "Twin USB Gamepad" and select "Game controller settings". Click on "Properties" and then on "Settings". Click on "Advanced" and use the sliders to change the values.
- To make your PS2 controller work with games that look for an Xbox 360 controller, you can use a third-party software called x360ce. This software emulates an Xbox 360 controller using your PS2 controller input. You can download x360ce from https://www.x360ce.com/ and follow the instructions on how to use it. This software also works together with the driver to enable rumble support in some games.

Using a PS2 controller on your PC is not as hard as it might seem. With a simple USB adapter and a driver, you can enjoy playing games with the classic DualShock 2 feel. You can also use an emulator or a third-party software to make your PS
