# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Because of limited resources and general compatibility 
between versions only the [latest release](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/releases) of Dompdf 
is actively supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In order to give the community time to respond and upgrade
we strongly urge you report all security issues privately. 
Please email us at security@dompdf.org with details and 
we will respond ASAP.
